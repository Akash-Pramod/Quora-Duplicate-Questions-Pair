# Quora-Duplicate-Questions-Pair
The project is based on Quora's questions data and build a model to find out that a given question on quora is already has an answer or not ?
This model is developed in Python using ML & DL with beautifulSoup for extraction.
Done the data preprocessing step with NLTK to handle with stopwords, punctuations etc.
For model building I used RandomForest Classifier and XGB Classifier.
RandomForest gives accuracy with 78.46% whereas XGB gives 79.26% accuracy.
